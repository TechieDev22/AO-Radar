# Play EVE without leaving EVE.

If you live in New Eden, you are probably used to having to alt+tab to web-based tools nearly every time you play. These tools are part of what makes playing EVE Online unlike any other game. However, it also ruins the immersion of the beautiful world CCP built.

EveVon is a EULA-legal way to extend the UI of EVE Online, bringing the tools you love directly into the game client.

In the near future, there will be a system allowing you to pick and choose (or develop!) plugins much like apps on your phone, complete with Android-style permissions for accessing your ESI data and EULA-legal-to-read files. You will be able to install and run anyone's tools while feeling safe about your computer and character's data.

# Installation and Usage
There is no complex setup process. Simply download the EveVon zip file from the releases page, extract it and run the EveVon file.

Make sure you have DirectX 9 disabled in launcher settings. Log into EVE and play as you normally would - the rest will come naturally to you. If there is a new version available, it will let you know.

If you are ever on an official CCP website (i.e. for ESI authentication) the window will flash green all the way to the edge of the window as shown in the link below

To shut down EveVon, simply select Quit from the tray menu where you change your volume and network settings in Windows.
